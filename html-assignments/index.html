      <h2 id="why" style="color: #1a73e8">Why I Joined the Program</h2>
      <p>
        I joined the cloud engineering programme because of my keen interest in
        building scalable, secure, and efficient cloud-based solutions. Cloud
        computing is transforming industries by offering innovative ways to
        manage and deploy resources, and I want to be at the forefront of that
        change. This programme provides a structured learning path, hands-on
        experience, and access to expert guidance, which are crucial for
        developing the skills needed to excel in this field. Additionally, the
        flexibility of an online school allows me to balance my learning with
        other commitments while gaining globally recognised expertise. I believe
        this program will provide me with the skills and opportunities to excel
        in the tech industry.
